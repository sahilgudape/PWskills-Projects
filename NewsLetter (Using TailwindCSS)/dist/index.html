          >writ large: Steve Jobs cofounded Apple in his parents garage in 1976,
          was ousted in 1985, returned to rescue it from near bankruptcy in
          1997, and by the time he died in October 2011, had built it into the
          worlds most valuable company, along the way he helped to tranform
          seven industries: personal computing, animated movies, music, phones,
          tablet computing, retail stores and digital publishing. He does
          belongs in the pantheons of America's great innovators, along with
          Thomas Edison, Henry ford and Walt Disney. None of these men was
          saint, but long after their personaloties are forgotten, history will
          remember how they applied imagination to business and technology.

            <p>One of the last times I saw him, after I had finished writing most of the book, I asked him again about his tendency to be rough on people. “Look at the results,” he replied. “These are all smart people I work with, and any of them could get a top job at another place if they were truly feeling brutalized. But they don't.” Then he paused for a few moments and said, almost wistfully, “And we got some amazing things done.” Indeed, he and Apple had had a string of hits over the past dozen years that was greater than that of any other innovative company in modern times: iMac, iPod, iPod nano, iTunes Store, Apple Stores, MacBook, iPhone, iPad, App Store, OS X Lion—not to mention every Pixar film. And as he battled his final illness, Jobs was surrounded by an intensely loyal cadre of colleagues who had been inspired by him for years and a very loving wife, sister, and four children.</p>
